        Writing is a hobby I have got into more recently. I started a little over a year ago.
        I don't write in a traditional sense of sitting down and coming up with everything on my own.<br>
        I get help from AI to help generate parts of the story, and most of the time it's just characters and their personalities.
        I also use characters or settings that other people came up with.<br>
        They allow people that struggle with character creation and world building to use them for their own personal writing.
